It contains code for testing and training separately. 
Testing folder name is: Final_project_tile_flip 
Training folder name is: Train_model_for_color 
 
Executing Live Training:
 1. Open the Final_project_tile_flip.sln file present in Train_model_for_color.sln present in Train_model_for_color/ Train_model_for_color/ folder.
 2. Execute the code by tapping F5.
 3. User will be prompt to record 15 utterance of each color(8). Once the recording is done, it will train the model.
 4. The updated model is stored in Train_model_for_color\ Train_model_for_color \Output\Average_Models.
 5. The final model file names are a_0.txt – a_7.txt , b_0.txt – b_7.txt
 6. Copy these files in Final_project_tile_flip/ Final_project_tile_flip/Input/ folder. 
Now the testing model is updated with new model. 

Executing Game(Testing):
 1. Open the Final_project_tile_flip.sln file present in Final_project_tile_flip/ Final_project_tile_flip/ folder.
 2. The project is compatible with visual studio 2010 and 2013. 
 3. Run the project, by tapping F5. (Debug-> Start Debugging).
 4. The system uses the pre-trained model for the game.
